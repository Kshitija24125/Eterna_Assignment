Axiom Pro – Cryptocurrency Trading Platform

This project is a modern, dark-themed cryptocurrency trading platform inspired by Axiom Pro. It replicates the visual design and core functionality of a professional trading dashboard, focusing on user experience, clarity, and responsiveness.

The goal of this project is to build an interactive front-end interface that displays trending cryptocurrency pairs with detailed market statistics, transaction data, and visual indicators. It serves as a front-end prototype that can later be extended with live API integrations for real-time trading data.

Key highlights include:
- A dark theme UI for a professional trading environment  
- Display of trending crypto pairs with market cap, liquidity, volume, and transaction counts  
- Interactive time filters (1m, 5m, 30m, 1h)  
- Color-coded values to represent market performance  
- Responsive layout for both desktop and mobile devices  

This project was developed to practice advanced front-end design principles and simulate a functional cryptocurrency trading dashboard using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
